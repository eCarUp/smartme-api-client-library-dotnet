# ![smart-me logo](Doc/icons/logo.png) Api Client Library for .Net

The smart-me Api Client Library enables you to integrate smart-me API functionality into your .Net application. It makes HTTP requests to the smart-me REST API ([see here](https://smart-me.com/swagger)). All HTTP request and response bodies are mapped to .Net classes.

## Examples

See the Example project in [`Src/Example`](Src/Example). You need a smart-me login which you can create [here](https://web.smart-me.com/login/). Set your username and password in [`Credentials.json`](Src/Example/Credentials.json). Please keep your username and password private.

## Requirements

.Net Framework 4.7.2+
